# Stress Analysis in Social Media

(courtesy: Liza Konopelko of Kaggle)

# Context

We live in an era where there is a surplus of information flowing in every second. Sometimes this leads to stress. ☹️
Too much stress can negatively impact our health and may lead to headaches, high blood pressure, heart problems, diabetes, skin conditions, asthma, arthritis, depression, and anxiety.

# Content

A dataset of lengthy multi-domain social media data for identifying stress from five different categories of Reddit communities.
